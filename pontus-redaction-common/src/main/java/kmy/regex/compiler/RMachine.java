/**
 *  This class represents "regex matching machine" that can be loaded with
 *  "RMachine instructions" and used later for regex matching. Subclasses
 *  of this class are used together with RCompiler (which compiles regex
 *  parsing tree into RMachine instructions). This class is used in the
 *  following fashion:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>First, hint method may be called to provide some properties of the
 *      regex about to be compiled.
 *  <li>Next, init() is called.
 *  <li>Next, various RMachine "instructions" are inserted (by calling
 *      corresponding RMachine methods).
 *  <li>Next, finish() is called.
 *  <li>Finally, call to makeRegex() returns the result of compilation.
 *  </ul>
 *  Single RMachine object is expected to be used only to compile a single
 *  regular expression.
 *  <p>
 *  RMachine can have a number of variables, and several character
 *  buffers (which a "pre-set" at runtime by a method external to RMachine
 *  (see Regex class documentation)). One of this buffers (main buffer) holds
 *  the string which this regex is being matched against. It also has an implicit
 *  character position that points into main buffer, as well as implicit
 *  instruction pointer that points to the RMachine instruction about to be executed.
 *  There is also a backtracing mechanism. When fork instruction is executed by
 *  the machine, it stores the value of the current character position and
 *  instruction pointer (that corresponds to the label given to the fork instruction)
 *  into special internal <i>backtracing stack</i> as a <i>fork record</i>.
 *  Also, for most modifications of RMachine variables (except for
 *  the hardAssign instruction), the original value (before assignment) is
 *  stored into backtracing stack. When fail instruction is executed, backtracing
 *  is performed. Information in backtracing stack is used to reverse assignments,
 *  reset character position and jump to the label given to the last fork instruction.
 *  Backtracing stack is cleared up to (and including) the last fork record. If
 *  not fork record is found in the stack, regex matching fails.
